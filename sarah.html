  <h3>Why I chose this topic</h3>
  <p>I chose The Sunbearer Trials because it’s one of the only books I read recently that actually made me forget I was reading and feel like I was inside the world. I’m obsessed with fantasy, and this book has everything I love: gods, magic, epic challenges, and characters who feel real even when they have powers. I especially loved the characters, like Teo and Aurelio, and their relationship became one of my favorite parts of the whole series. Reading the second book, Celestial Monsters, made me love them even more, and it made going back to the first book feel even more special. I also love how Aiden Thomas doesn’t just make the main characters amazing but gives the side characters their own lore, personalities, and moments that make the whole world feel alive. The story shows different identities and friendships in a fun, natural way, and it made me care about everyone so much. It’s the kind of book that made me stay up way too late, so I thought it would be awesome to make my website about it and share how cool it is.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>“Only the most powerful and honorable semidioses get chosen. I’m just a Jade. I’m not a real hero.”</p>

<p>As each new decade begins, the Sun’s power must be replenished so that Sol can keep traveling along the sky and keep the evil Obsidian gods at bay. Ten semidioses between the ages of thirteen and eighteen are selected by Sol himself as the most worthy to compete in The Sunbearer Trials. The winner carries light and life to all the temples of Reino del Sol, but the loser has the greatest honor of all—they will be sacrificed (by the winner) to Sol, their body used to fuel the Sun Stones that will protect the people of Reino del Sol for the next ten years.</p>

<p>Teo, a 17-year-old Jade semidiós and the trans son of Quetzal, goddess of birds, has never worried about the Trials…or rather, he’s only worried for others. His best friend Niya—daughter of Tierra, the god of earth—is one of the strongest heroes of their generation and is much too likely to be chosen this year. He also can’t help but worry (reluctantly, and under protest) for Aurelio, a powerful Gold semidiós and Teo’s friend-turned-rival who is a shoo-in for the Trials. Teo wouldn’t mind taking Aurelio down a notch or two, but a one-in-ten chance of death is a bit too close for Teo’s taste.</p>

<p>But then, for the first time in over a century, Sol chooses a semidiós who isn’t a Gold. In fact, he chooses two: Xio, the 13-year-old child of Mala Suerte, god of bad luck, and…Teo. Now they must compete in five mysterious trials, against opponents who are both more powerful and better trained, for fame, glory, and their own survival.</p>

<h1>Everyone Deserves to Donate Their Brains</h1>
<p>In my opinion the human race is already wasted with useless scientists not performing to their full potential. If they used their full capacity they would be able to have superpowers and be better than all else, and that is why we should donate peoples brains to science. By donating their brains it would be a sacrafic for humanity and a way for people to access their full potential by using the brains that are altered. The altered brains are the brains of the people that have donated, but the real question is who will donate?</p>
<p>The people who will donate are the iluminati members, such as myself who will donate their brains for the advancement of science. I unfortunantly cannot donate because i need to be one of the people who will get the brains and also one of the scientists leading the project</p>

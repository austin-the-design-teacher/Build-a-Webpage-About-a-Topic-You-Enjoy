  <h1>Clash Royale</h1>
  <p> Clash Royale is a fun and interesting game. I personally have played it for 6.8 years, and love it. It consists of cards which you upgrade and choose to make a deck. You win games to climb ranks and do fun events and win rewards. Clash royale is also a game you can play with your freinds as you can 1v1 them for team up in a 2v2. </p>
